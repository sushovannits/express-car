## API

### get-cars
This is like starting the clock of life. Pet cannot be created without starting the clock.

## Implementation Details
- Vorpal is used for cli farmework
- Architecture is such that states, action, etc. can be extended easily
- Everything is as much decoupled as possible.
- Can be easily extended to multiple pets at the same time.
- Can be extended to become a RESTful app by swapping the ui.js
- All configurations are in config.js

## Unit Test
```
yarn run test
```
**Warning**: In unit test, there is a pending promise problem. It has to be resolved. But testcases run fine.
